"""
Collect results from raw run directories into per-method CSVs.

For each method directory in the results dir, does a single pass:
  1. Finds the latest run per (benchmark, model)
  2. Reads metrics.json, the GPT-5.4 contamination judgement
     (judgement_gpt5_4_rerun.json if present, else judgement_gpt5_4.json),
     the API usage judgement (judgement_api_rerun.json if present, else
     judgement_api.json; absent for runs predating that judge), the
     PTB-lookup judgement (same rerun-over-original preference; archival —
     a True verdict raises instead of affecting scores), and time_taken.txt
  3. Applies baseline fallback for cells flagged by the contamination or
     API judge, or with no run
  4. Writes final_{method}.csv, contamination_{method}.csv

Also writes a time_overview.csv summarising average time per method.

The general (unknown-unknowns) judgement (judgement_general[_rerun].json) is
deliberately ignored here: it never affects a score, and neither its absence
nor a True verdict raises.

Judge coverage: every scored run (metrics.json present) must carry a
contamination and an API verdict, and — for run ids >=
NEWER_JUDGES_MIN_RUN_ID (see utils.py) — a PTB-lookup verdict too. A method containing a scored run without a required verdict is NOT
aggregated: collect.py warns, writes no CSVs for that method (removing stale
ones from earlier collects), and continues with the other methods. Rerun the
missing judges on the listed runs, then re-run collect.py. Unfinished or
broken runs (no metrics.json) never trigger the skip — they take the
baseline fallback as before, so collecting mid-sweep stays possible.

Any missing or malformed metrics.json / contamination judgement / time_taken.txt
inside an existing run directory is a hard error — there are no silent
fallbacks for broken runs. Cells with no run at all are filled from
baselines.json.

Usage:
    python collect.py
    python collect.py --data-dir /path/to/results --output-dir /path/to/output
    python collect.py --min-run-id 100 --max-run-id 200

READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING A NUMBER FROM THIS RESULTS TREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script is the benchmark's official score, and on the local results tree
(/rmeng_data/robtang/ptb-results) it has never produced one. As of 2026-09-04:
241 cells carry a metrics.json and *zero* judgement files exist anywhere in the
tree, because .env sets POST_TRAIN_BENCH_SKIP_JUDGES="1" and every cell was run
with the judges off.

So every PostTrainBench figure quoted from that tree — in a board markdown, a
paper table, a memory note — is a raw metrics.json accuracy: a decode of
final_model on the task, with no contamination verdict, no disallowed-base-model
verdict, no API-usage verdict, and therefore no baseline fallback ever applied.
That is a real number and it is not the benchmark's number. The gap is not
hypothetical: an answer-key leak on the 89727/89809 board was found by
ptb_ops/answer_key_audit.py, not by a judge, and it is exactly the kind of thing
the contamination judge exists to catch.

Two independent things block a judged score, and fixing either alone is not
enough:
  1. the judges cannot run — the ChatGPT subscription session they use is
     revoked (token_revoked / 401 on codex 0.124.0 and 0.153.2 alike), and
     src/judges/judge_lib.sh wants agents/codex_non_api/auth.json, which does not
     exist in this checkout. Restoring it needs an interactive `codex logout &&
     codex login` by the account owner; nothing headless can do it;
  2. this script cannot aggregate a pack — every cell here is
     gsm8k x Qwen3-1.7B-Base and walk_latest_runs returns one run per
     (benchmark, model), so eight GPU seats of one job collapse to one slot. It
     now refuses rather than dropping seven of eight silently.
